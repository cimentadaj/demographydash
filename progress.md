Deaths/Births compare legend now mirrors the YADR approach: the ribbon reuses simulation fill colours but stays out of the Plotly legend, leaving only Projection vs UN Projection entries.
New compare tabs for broad age groups and growth rates use shared simulation colours plus distinct linetypes per age group, matching the single-run behaviour.
Scatter compare plots for population size & aging, CDR vs life expectancy, and CBR vs TFR now share colours per simulation while using projection/UN shapes to mirror the single-run icons.
